        <h2>Getting Tickets and Picking the Shows</h2>
        <p>
           If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag.
           But I wasn't so lucky or connected my first 2 year so I'm here to help you out.
           First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this
           is a biggie; SET A BUGDET. If you're worrying about blowing your cash the whole time
           you won't have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers
           you want to see most. Lastly, pucharse your tickets and get excited!

        <h2>Dressing for the show</h2>
        <p>
           Always be truth to your own sense of style, if you don't you'll be uncomfortable the 
           the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and 
           taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines. Also 
           it's important to wear shoes you'll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to
           look good, but you'll be on your feet all day long so be prepared.
